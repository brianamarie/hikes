Web Design Vs. Web Development video script:

How vs What

Web design is the HOW of applications. Web designers create the look and feel of the application. They play a major role in the UX and UI by determining which colors to use, where menus/buttons go, and everything visual regarding the application.

Web developing is the WHAT of applications. Web developers create the functionality of the application. Their role impacts how the UX and UI works, what the menus/buttons do, and everything that happens on the client (front-end) and the server (back-end).

An example of design on a car is choosing how the dash board, instrument panel will look, leather bucket seats, allow wheels, and a spoiler.

An example of development on a car is building the engine, the intake and exhaust system, making it a hybrid instead of a gas vehicle, etc.

An example of web design on FCC is choosing the location of the user sign-up and sign-in buttons, fonts, brown borders, and outdoorsy imagery on the site.

An example of web development on FCC is choosing what the user sign-up and sign-in process will include, what tools to use to display the fonts, borders, and camp imagery and then making it happen.

Web Design is the HOW, the look and feel of web applications.

Web Development is the WHAT, the execution, the engine.
